//The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number 
//that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform 
//distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range.
//The given function gets random number from 0 to almost 1 and multiplies it on 10

//In JavaScript, concat() is a string method that is used to concatenate strings together.
// The concat() method appends one or more string values to the calling
// string and then returns the concatenated result as a new string.
